# Failed Bank Analysis (2000 - Present) 
_A business-valued focus analytical project usign FDIC failed bank data._

___
## Executive Summmary 
Between 2000 and 2025, There has been over **500 U.S. banks failed**, concentrated during the **2008-2012 financial crisis**. 

**Key Findings**
- Closures peaked during 2009 and 2010 with the total banks closed, peaking over 150 failures per year.
- Failures were concentrated in a 10 states, the main contendors being **Georgia, Florida, and Illinois**.
- Many large institutions absorbed failed banks, highlighting _Industry Consolidation_
- Since 2015, failures have been rare, emphasising the **post-crisis resilience**
___ 

 ## Background and Overview
 The purpose of this project is to analyze the FDIC's "Failed Bank List," inheriently covering all the U.S. bank closures since October 2000.

 The Goal: **extract actionable insight** for banks, regulators, and investors. 
 ## Background & Overview
This project analyzes the FDIC “Failed Bank List,” covering all U.S. bank closures since October 2000.  
The goal: **extract actionable insights** for regulators, banks, and investors.  

**Business questions addressed:**  
1. **When** did failures cluster most heavily?  
   → Failures spiked in 2009–2010, with more than 150 closures per year. 

2. **Where** were closures concentrated geographically?  
   → Failures were heavily concentrated in Southeastern and Midwestern states (e.g., Georgia, Florida, Illinois).  

3. **Who** absorbed failed banks, and how concentrated was that activity?  
   → A small set of repeat acquirers accounted for ~50% of resolutions. Consolidation was especially high during the 2009–2011 crisis.  

4. **How** did consolidation trends change over time?  
   → The Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) shows that acquirer concentration peaked during the financial crisis, then declined as failures became rare post-2015.  

5. **What signals** might help anticipate future risk?  
   → Geographic hotspots and repeat acquirer behavior suggest systemic vulnerabilities in community banking during downturns.

___

## Recommendations
- **Regulators:**  
  Focus supervision on historically high-risk states and smaller community banks.  
- **Banks:**  
  Maintain capital buffers and M&A strategies for downturn periods.  
- **Investors:**  
  Track regional exposure and acquirer activity as **M&A opportunities** during crises.

## Interactive Streamlit App

This project includes a fully interactive **Streamlit web application** (`app.py`) that provides an enhanced user experience for exploring the failed bank data.

### Features
- **Interactive filtering** focused by year range and state selection
- **Real-time metrics** displaying total failures, peak year, and top state
- **Dynamic visualizations** including:
  - Failures per year (interactive bar chart)
  - Geographic hotspots (choropleth map of US states)
  - Consolidation analysis (treemap of acquiring institutions)
  - HHI trends over time (market concentration analysis)
- **Data upload capability** to analyze custom CSV files
- **Automatic data cleaning** for various CSV formats

### Running the App
```bash
# Install Streamlit (if not already installed)
pip install streamlit

# Run the interactive app
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will launch in your browser at `http://localhost:8501` (or the next available port).

### Technical Details
- **Data Processing**: Automatic column cleaning and date parsing
- **Visualization**: Built with Plotly for interactive charts
- **Performance**: Cached data loading for fast filtering
- **Responsive Design**: Wide layout useful for data exploration

This interactive version complements the static analysis in the Jupyter notebook, providing a more accessible way for stakeholders to explore the data and generate insights on-demand.
